Tic Tac Toe game

This is the second project for The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum. The objective for this project was to create
a Tic Tac Toe game that can be played within the browser. The main goal was to have as little global code as possible,
and to stick to the module pattern. 

When the page is opened, the user is presented the option of renaming the first and second players, or just starting
the game with the default names. Players alternate clicking squares to place either an X or an O, and the first player 
to have three X's or three O's vertically, horizontally, or diagonally is declared the winner. The game can be restarted
with the same players or quit to rename the players at any time using the Restart and New Game buttons.

I intend to come back and add an option to play against a computer player in the future.
